# Weather Dashboard


## Purpose
A weather application that uses a third party API to call local weather in real time from the city entered in the search bar.
Once Searched the user will see the current weather in their city as well as a 5 day forecast.

Once a user searches a site a button is created and saved to local storage where they can call the city again if they so choose.

The site saves tasks to local storage.
